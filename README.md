This is a simple **Scientific Calculator** Android app built using **Java**. It includes basic arithmetic operations as well as advanced scientific functions such as trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential calculations.

## Features

- **Basic Operations**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.
- **Scientific Operations**: Trigonometric (Sine, Cosine, Tangent), Logarithmic, Exponential, Square Root, and more.
- **Memory Functions**: Store and retrieve values in memory.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Clean and easy-to-use interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Android**: The platform used to build the app.
- **Java**: The programming language used for app development.
- **Android SDK**: Tools and libraries for Android development.
